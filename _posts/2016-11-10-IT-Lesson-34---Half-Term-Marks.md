    <td>The way I learned in this lesson was by listening to and looking at the grades of blogs that were reviewed in front of the entire class. I compared them against mine to get a good idea of what my grade will be at this moment. While listening  to the teacher, I formed my own strategy for being more insightful and deep thinking in my blog posts (I've tried it out here!).</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nothing limited my learning today as there weren't any distractions in the lesson as it was mostly listening to the teacher with a little bit of working on our blogs at the very end of the chat about marks. I also want to work on doing my blog posts as soon as possible after school ends so that I donâ€™t have much to to forget about anything that I want to write. </td>

    <td>Next time, I will take notes on what the teacher was saying and I will make sure that I have remember everything. Then it will be very hard for me to forget about it and I will be able to improve on my work and my learning as much as possible. If you want to build your own blog, there is a video below to show you how to do so...</td>
