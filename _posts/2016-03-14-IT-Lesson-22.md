Today in IT, we were told about an amazing new website called **Prezi**. With it, you can do very interesting and engaging presentations that you otherwise would not be able to do in PowerPoint. It uses cool techniques such as: zooming, changing the perspective of who is reading it and much more! I think that **Prezi** is a very useful website that can be used by students, like me, to just do that little bit extra and get the top mark in the class. As **Prezi** says, 'It turns *Good* presentations, into *Great* presentations. With **Prezi**, you can go the one step further and impress your audience. I think that it is a brilliant way of making an interesting presentation. We were then given homework to, with the account we had created in the lesson, experiment and â€˜play around' with the zoom controls and the path that the presentation takes. If you want to try it out for yourself and impress your friends/family, just click [here](https://prezi.com).
