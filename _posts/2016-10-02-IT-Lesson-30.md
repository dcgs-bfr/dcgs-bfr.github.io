    <td>I learned by asking my teacher sometimes for help. But mostly by doing what he suggested, which was step by step, asking myself: How do I change this? How do I do that? This ended in me having a more professional looking blog that I am very happy with.</td>

    <td>Next time, I will try to create translucent boxes to put my posts in so that you are able to see more clearly what the words say. Also I will fix a problem where not all of the fonts are the same because I want them all to be 'Arial'.</td>
