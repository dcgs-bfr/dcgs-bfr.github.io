    <td>I learned by exploring what I could do but also trying to find the simplest ways to perform the action that I was instructed to do.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not much limited my learning as I 'put my head down' and focused on what I needed to do. Sometimes I asked my partner for help but he guided me towards finding out the answer to my problem instead of just telling me the answer to it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, hopefully we will start going a bit earlier (this lesson we had to spend about 15mins being told how to navigate the website and we were switching IT rooms) and I will be able to get more done and thus will make further progress.</td>
