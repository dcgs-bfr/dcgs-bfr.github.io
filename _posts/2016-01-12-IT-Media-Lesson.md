In IT on Monday the 11th we learnt about Media. We learnt how media can come in many different forms. Movies, Advertisements, TV, Newspapers, Comic books and Magazines. It can be true or false. Media is just a way of getting a message to YOU. We looked at the 2014 Kia Hamster Ad and thought about: Who is the Target audience?, What is the subtext? and What are the untold stories? We were then given homework to chose our own Ad and answer the same questions about it.
