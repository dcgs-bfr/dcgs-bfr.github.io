Today in IT, we split up into two new groups for lessons. I am happy because I have the same awesome teacher as last year. I was also happy because I got to work with my friend. Today we did some coding on a machine that has a Raspberry Pi 3 inside it. We connected it to a mouse and a power supply and since there weren't any more cables left, we got to connect it to the teachers awesome 24" monitor at the front. When we started coding, we took turns using the basic 'Say' and Repeat’ commands and got the machine to say ‘Hello World’. Then we fiddled around with the colours and backgrounds. It was a very fun lesson and I can't wait to find out what the next one will be.
