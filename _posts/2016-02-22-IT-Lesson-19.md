Today in IT we looked at the projects that we were given as homework for the half term. It was interesting to 'sum up' my personality on one page like I did for my identity map. I wasn’t too nervous about other people seeing it because I didn't really add anything that they didn't already know. It felt very different looking at other people's work and commenting because I found out a lot about people that I didn't know. I liked the way we did this. When I read back through my comments I was amazed to see that not one of my comments were bad. They were all: ‘Great detail’. This is very different as we have met them before. This told me that I should post less pictures of myself and more of some cool stuff that I want my followers to see. There arnt and changes that I want to make to my identity map. These six lessons didn't really change my view of social media. This didn't really change how I plan on using social media in the future as I kind of already knew before we started this topic.
