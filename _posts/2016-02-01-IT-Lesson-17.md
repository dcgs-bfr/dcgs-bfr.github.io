This week in IT we talked more about social media. We watched a video about Twitter and it portrayed youthful, good looking people, who do everything on twitter. They sung about how awesome Twitter is and how much you can do on it. However, this made me think about all of the stupid things people do on social media. Also it was just as stereotypical as other media because it made the assumption that, if you are on twitter, YOU ARE good looking. This was quite amusing, because I am sure that there are some, not good looking people, who still love the occasional laugh from someone else's Tweet. We were then given the homework to ask three questions, that were given to us, to one of our relatives. They were about what social media they have and what they do on it.
