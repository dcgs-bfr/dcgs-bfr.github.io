This lesson, we continued our study on Media. Our teacher asked us to stand on a certain side of the room judging by our opinion (Yes or No) to the statement. For e.g 'I use social media almost every day'. My answer was ‘Yes’ to that question. We also watched some Ads and we saw the difference between a McDonalds Burger (from the ad) and a McDonalds burger (In the store). We also watched a documentary about this. It turns out that they use a food stylist to make sure all of the ingredients are visible in the commercial and then they take several photos and touch it up in Photoshop. This entire process takes several hours. It was a very interesting lesson. I enjoyed it very much. We were also given homework that was to fill in the PDF on our Google Classroom that we have for IT.
