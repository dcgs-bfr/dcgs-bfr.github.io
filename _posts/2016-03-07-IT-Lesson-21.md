Today in IT we learnt a lot about computers and different types of viruses. We were told to answer these six questions.

* What are peripherals? They are anything that you attach or plug in to the computer externally.

* What is a virus? It is a program that I designed for malicious reasons to cause harm to someone's computer. They spread by attaching themselves to other files.

* What is a trojan? This is a virus that prevents itself in a seemingly innocent way that is really something malicious. For e.g: "Click here for One Million Dollars!".

* What is a worm? This is a type of virus that can self replicate and 'latch' onto other software and hardware. It can also replicate over networks.

* What is spyware? What does it do? This a software that enables someone to get access to another user/computers activities by transmitting data unnoticed from their hard drive.

* How to viruses and other malware spread through systems? Usually, like worms, they self replicate and 'latch' onto other programs in order to spread through as many devices as possible unnoticed.

I thought that this was a very interesting lesson. It also made me download an antivirus even though I was confident that I wouldn't get a virus on a Mac.
