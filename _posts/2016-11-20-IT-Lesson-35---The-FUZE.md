    <td>Me and my partner both tried to understand how the wires worked and what made them work and what they did. It was very hard as this was our first time doing them. We had previously only done coding and not really physically moved things around.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>There were a few distractions as the pair next to us was messing around a lot but we tried to ignore them. Also, the instructions were not very clear and the pictures that showed us what to do were not taken at the right angle and we couldn't really see which sockets to plug wires into.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, we will sit somewhere different  so that we wonâ€™t be distracted by anyone. Also, if we are very stuck on the task with wires, we will seek the help of the teacher so that we can learn as much as possible.</td>
