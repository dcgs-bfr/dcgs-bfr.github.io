Today in IT, we were in the same group as last lesson and we went even further on the coding we had previously been doing. We assembled the computer with the huge monitor owned by the teacher and we started coding. It was very interesting but since we hadn't saved any of our work on a usb drive, we had to re do all of what we had done last lesson. We again developed our knowledge with learning how to change the colour of the text and the background of the command prompt. After that we learned how to make the computer to math for us and the programming that allowed it to do that. Unfortunately, halfway through the lesson, we were told to move rooms as then we wouldn't need to use terrible monitors but the room we were moving too was taken and we had to go all the way back and plug everything back in. Despite this, it was again a very interesting lesson that I learned a lot from and I look forward to our lesson next week.
