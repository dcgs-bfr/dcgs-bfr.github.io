Last Year was an awesome year for me. I had lots and lots of fun and learned a lot of things. IT was one of my favourite lessons. Some of the things we did were: Coding, Building a blog, Making a game using Scratch and E-safety. All of which I really enjoyed. I feel that using the knowledge that I acquired in Year 7, I'll be able to have a great year in Year 8 too. Some of my strengths were: I was able to understand the task at hand fairly easily and was able to get very quickly, I was very enthusiastic about IT all throughout the year, I never gave up when something went wrong in the lesson or during homework and I would try to fix it or seek help from the teacher. I think that I only had one main weakness and that was that I wasn't very good at using other knowledge and working as a team because I prefer working on my own. Despite this, I kept trying to work with others well in IT and in all other lessons. I can't wait to 'get crackinâ€™ with this years IT.
