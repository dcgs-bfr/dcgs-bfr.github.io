Today in IT, we were in a different room as we didn't need the computers. We had an E-safety lesson. We talked about a range of things. The conversation start out with, What is the internet used for? The class gave many different answers such as: Entertainment and Communication. It then moved on to, What are you scared of on the internet? Again there were many different answers. Most commonly, we had inappropriate material as an answer in many different forms such as: adult material such as pornography or graphical images and videos. It was a very interesting lesson that I enjoyed and learnt a lot from about the internet and my class. We were given the homework to find news articles on '[Revenge Porn]([http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36054273](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36054273))’ and ‘[Sexting]([http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35577506](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35577506))’. The articles are linked on the words.
