In IT today we handed in our Prezi presentations that we were given over half term. From what I saw about the effort of the other boys in my class, I'm confident that I will get a high mark. We looked at three other boys’ presentations during the lesson. One was a good example of a piece of work that had a lot of attention to detail but not enough attention to aesthetics. The second one was one that the teacher had given an F grade. It was a good example of a piece of work that did not have enough detail and wasn't a very good use of Prezi. The last one that we saw was made by a boy from another class. It was not very good because there were a lot of sections where you could see some obvious plagiarism (copy and pasting). Also, it was not a very good use of Prezi either. My presentation is below if you’d like to see it…
