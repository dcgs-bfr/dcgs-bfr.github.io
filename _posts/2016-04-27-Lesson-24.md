Today in It, it was the deadline for the 'retouching' of our Prezi presentations that we were told to do last last lesson. Next week we should get our marks back. I think I will get a good mark. During the lesson, we used a website called **BBC micro:bit**. We used this website to code our own ‘Sorting Hat’ esque program that would, when you press a button, put you in either: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw. It was very interesting and fun. I’m not sure what programming language we were using but it was very simple and easy to use. Once we had programmed that program. We changed the code so that, when two different buttons were pressed, it would sort a person in our class into a house in our school. This was a very fun and interesting lesson that I thoroughly enjoyed. Here is the finished product of my prezi presentation:
