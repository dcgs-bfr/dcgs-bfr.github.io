    <td>This was a really fun and interesting lesson as I was finally able to start playing around and figuring out the robot arms. It was very cool how they worked and it took me a little while to get rid of them. Close to the end of the lesson, my teacher challenged me to pick up a pencil with the robot arm. It succeeded!</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>Unfortunately, my partner was sick today and I wasn't able to get as much done as I could have. However, I moved away from the students who were being disruptive and I got a lot more done than I would have.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will move on to making code sequences for the robot arm in order to get it to perform certain tasks and also, it will be nice to have my partner back so that we can get more done.</td>
