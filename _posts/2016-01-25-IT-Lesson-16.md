Today we looked at the advantages and disadvantages of "Social Media". Unfortunately, most of our form was very pessimistic and, in this instance, the disadvantages outweighed the advantages but A LOT. This meant that there was more discussion about the good things than the bad things. We talked about how, your social media account could be hacked and people could post bad things that you don't mean; there is not a lot of privacy. For e.g: Twitter was made so that people had no privacy. Also, we talked about how, there is a section of the internet where there are only certain access points and, once you are in, you are virtually free to: hire assassins, buy drugs, or do virtually anything that could possibly be nefarious. We were then given home that was, to fill in the google drive pdf (converted into a google doc) about how social media could affect our future and our ambitions.
