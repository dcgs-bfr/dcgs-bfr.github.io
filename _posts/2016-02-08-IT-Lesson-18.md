Today we looked more at social media personalities and how you are most likely going to portray a different image of yourself online than in real life. We talked about addiction and how social media can be just as serious of an addiction as drugs and alcohol. We said that if you go on social media more than once every day, and if you check it before more important things like school/work emails, you are ADDICTED to it. Even though some people say that they NEED social media, there are plenty of people who haven't even bothered to 'sign up'. We looked at the teachers school and private facebook accounts and they were very different. The school one was just in so that he could help students if something went wrong. He didn't really look at it much. However, his private account portrayed a different image than the IT teacher we know and love. We were give homework to make a mind map of all of the things that we consider to be part of our IDENTITY, while also emphasising how we would like other people to see us.
