Today in IT, we had a follow up lesson on our internet safety lesson and finished it as a topic. We then moved onto the subject of propaganda and how it is used in many different ways to convince people of an opinion. We were given the homework to include in our blog post three examples of propaganda articles from recent news stories and to write a paragraph about them.

[**1.) Hillary Clinton's Hypocrisy**]([http://video.foxnews.com/v/5035650726001/kennedy-hillary-clintons-hypocrisy-is-magnificent/?intcmp=obinsite#sp=show-clips](http://video.foxnews.com/v/5035650726001/kennedy-hillary-clintons-hypocrisy-is-magnificent/?intcmp=obinsite#sp=show-clips))

I chose this article because it was from Fox News and they usually have biased articles that contain propaganda. The reason that I think that this is propaganda is because it has been said the Republican Nominee Donald Trump **"has Fox news in his pocket"** so it is natural that you would see bias against the Democratic party and Hillary Clinton. Also, you can clearly see in the title that it is propaganda because they have used very descriptive words to describe the *bad* things that Hillary has done.

[**2.) Obama Administration to Blame**]([http://video.foxnews.com/v/5038439756001/obama-administration-to-blame-for-coup-attempt-in-turkey/?#sp=show-clips](http://video.foxnews.com/v/5038439756001/obama-administration-to-blame-for-coup-attempt-in-turkey/?#sp=show-clips))

Once again, I chose Fox News because of the repeatedly bias articles. This article was aimed at *putting down* the Obama administration in favour of Donald Trump. It was made to convince the watchers/readers to go with Fox News and to support Trump whist disliking Obama. It is also propaganda because it has introduced a negative view of a person in order to get the audience to agree with them.

[**3.) Nicola Sturgeon suggests VETO**]([http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3694344/Nicola-Sturgeon-suggests-veto-trigger-Brexit-process-Theresa-Scotland-strong-position.html](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3694344/Nicola-Sturgeon-suggests-veto-trigger-Brexit-process-Theresa-Scotland-strong-position.html))

I have chosen The Daily Mail for this article as they are another reliable source of propaganda and biased articles. This article is an example of both. There is a kind of subliminal message contained in the title of this article because they have deliberately capitalised the word *veto* in order to push people to the decision of vetoing Article 50 to a vote in parliament. This is propaganda because it is a piece of media that was made to convince people of a particular opinion and to get them to join a side.
