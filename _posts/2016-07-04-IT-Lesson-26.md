Today in IT, we had a follow up lesson on the internet safety lesson that we had last week. We talked more about the dangers of sexting and how it can, almost always, lead to revenge porn. We also discussed the emotional and physical dangers of revenge porn and how it can get you into serious trouble socially and also physically. Revealing images of you might be shared around your school and it might make you feel very depressed and not want to go to school anymore. It can also drive people to commit suicide. We also talked about the flipside of revenge porn and instead of being the victim, we thought about being the offender. The teacher told us about how not only we could get in trouble with the law, we could also get in trouble with a very angry family member. That might decide the a criminal punishment was not enough. It was a very eye opening lesson and it was very educational. At the end of the lesson, we were given our [Microbits](https://www.microbit.co.uk) and we were given the homework to continue working on our code. I fixed an error with Syntax and an error where I had used a function instead of an 'if' statement.
