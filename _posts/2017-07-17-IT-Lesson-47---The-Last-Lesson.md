This year in IT was very enjoyable and interesting. We learned a lot of skills as well as working on them and improving them. We spent the majority the year with coding on the FUZE boxes. I worked with my friend Nivethan and we made great progress on the FUZE box and managed to program lots of different programs onto a little device with LEDs. We learned how to program with a Rasperry Pi. Later in the term we started programming a robotic arm and that was very fun as the teacher would tell us things to do. Then we did drama for a term and came to to doing some IT. We came back to learn Python on Codecademy which as been very fun, It has been a great year!
