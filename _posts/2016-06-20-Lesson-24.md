Today in IT, we all went through the problems as a class with our GitHub repositories. If we'd been using a Barry Clark forked version, we had to fork a new one in order to get the updated version. This was kind of a nuisance because mine was working fine and then I would have to repost all of my past posts, however I went along with it because it meant that there wouldn't be any errors later. We didn't do any work on our **Micro:bit** code today but we did find out that our **micro:bits** had been sent for shipping and that they would be arriving soon. When I was personalising my blog in the **style.scss** file, I started to understand what the code meant. This made it easier for me to do it this time rather than the first time around. At the end of the lesson, I had figured out my new blog settings and we were given the homework to finish off configuring the **style.scss** file.
