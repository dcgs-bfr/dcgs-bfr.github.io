<h2>About me</h2>

An extreme left wing kid who kinda' understands HTML and SCSS. I love to code, and play videogames. I'm a complete maths geek and I'm very interested in science and politics. Especially elections!

<h3>About the Blog...</h3>

This is an ongoing project for school where I make a post every week after my IT lesson. It will be about anything from internet safety to how to perfet if, then, else statements in JavaScript! I also intend to show how well I am doing in lessons and what I can do to improve/change what I am doing well. The time that I will be still making blog posts is currently indefinate. (Hopefully it stays that way as it's very fun!). Enjoy!
